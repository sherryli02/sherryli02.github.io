        <h1>eliminate distractions</h1>
        <p>
            We live in a world where nearly everything is designed to distract us, and our brains are wired for it. We focus better if there’s nothing else that can grab our attention. Consider working in a quiet location, silencing all notifications, and shutting off other external factors: <a href="stop-multitasking-1.html">everything that isn’t what you want to focus</a> on.
