			<p1 class="clown-text-3">Seriously. Yeah. My parents had to — everybody ran out. It was terrifying. It was the only time I’ve ever been to the circus.</p1>
			<p1 class="clown-text-4">I said those things. But I actually made the whole thing up. It’s coming back to haunt me. I said it on some show. It was really early in the morning the day after the New York premiere. Someone asked me what my experience with the circus was and I was like, I have nothing interesting to say. I don’t know why I said that!</p1>

			<p1 class="hair-text-2">It's the funniest thing. I just wear a hat a lot. I have so much residue crap in my hair from years and years and years of not washing it and not having any sense of personal hygiene whatsoever. Even today, I go into these things where I'm supposed to be this sexy guy or whatever, and I'm literally asking [the studio rep] if I get plumes of dandruff on me, can you just brush it off.</p1>
			<p1 class="hair-text-3">What did you learn by not washing your hair for six weeks?</p1>
			<p1 class="hair-text-4">That it starts to wash itself. If you don't wash it for six weeks, you won't have to wash it ever again. Until it gets unbearable.</p1>
